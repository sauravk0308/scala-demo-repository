# The official repository for the Rock the JVM Akka HTTP with Scala course (Udemy edition)

This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Akka HTTP with Scala](https://www.udemy.com/akka-http) course on Udemy. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

### How to install
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.

### How to start

Clone this repository and checkout the `start` tag by running the following in the repo folder:

```
git checkout start
```

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the lectures. Prior to each lecture, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `1.1-scala-recap`
* `1.2-akka-recap`
* `1.3-akka-streams-recap`
* `2.1-low-level-api`
* `2.2-low-level-api-exercise`
* `2.3-marshalling-json`
* `2.4-low-level-server-with-json`
* `2.5-low-level-server-query-params`
* `2.6-low-level-https`
* `3.1-high-level-intro`
* `3.2-directives-breakdown`
* `3.3-directives-breakdown-part-2`
* `3.4-high-level-example`
* `3.5-high-level-exercise`
* `3.6-marshalling-json`
* `3.7-marshalling-json-part-2`
* `3.8-dealing-with-rejections`
* `3.9-handling-exceptions`
* `3.10-routing-testkit`
* `3.11-websockets`
* `3.12-uploading-files`
* `3.13-jwt`
* `4.1-client-connection-level-api`
* `4.2-host-level-api`
* `4.3-request-level-api`

When you watch a lecture, you can `git checkout` the appropriate tag and the repo will go back to the exact code I had when I started the lecture.
